# Docker Django Boilerplate

Minimal setup for a Django project with Docker, following 
[the 12factor app](https://12factor.net/) principles. This repo contains 
skeleton code to get up and running with Docker & Django quickly. The 
image uses [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/) to host the 
Django project. It's up to you to put Nginx or Apache in front in 
production.  

This image is **not intended** as being a base image for a Django project.
It's a boilerplate, you can copy/paste this and use it as a base to 
start a project. The image contains the *hello* Django project. 
[Replace the word *hello* with the name of *your project*](docs/rename.md).

## Usage

Download the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lukin0110/docker-django-boilerplate.git
```

Init project:
```
$ cd docker-django-boilerplate
$ docker-compose build
```

Setup database:
```
$ docker-compose up -d postgres
$ docker-compose run app setup_db
```

Launch:
```
$ docker-compose up app
```

Launch Nginx *(optional)*:
```
$ docker-compose up web
```

*Now your django app is available on http://localhost, but it's optional for development*
